## subtron
Let the subtron do the subdomain enumeration for you at once with subfinder, assetfinder and with amass.

## Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/cyberatull/subtron.git

```
chmod +x setup subtron

no need to run setup file if you have subfinder, assetfinder, amass and httpx already in your machine if yes so skip bash setup and run:
```
sudo cp subtron /usr/local/bin
```

now you can use subtron anywhere from terminal
