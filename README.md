## 🔍 About
`Subtron` is an **automated subdomain enumeration script** written in **Bash**, built for bug hunters, penetration testers, and security researchers.  

It combines multiple powerful tools:
- [Amass](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass)
- [Subfinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder)
- [Assetfinder](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder)
- [Httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx)
- `crt.sh` (certificate transparency logs)

All results are deduplicated and stored neatly in `results/<domain>/`.

---

## ⚡ Features
- Runs **multiple enumeration tools in parallel**  
- **Silent mode** → only shows status messages, not noisy tool output  
- Saves **unique domains** & **live hosts**  
- Colorized output with progress messages  
- Organized results per domain
